            I am currently an AP student at St. Edmund Campion, able to speak an intermediate amount of French, and independent enough to live in Quebec by myself for a French program over the course of three weeks. I always like to plan out situations beforehand, so I can approach any problem with persistence. As a drama student, I am able to quickly improvise problems, memorize information, and be very creative. As a piano student, I have learned to be more disciplined, studying every day to learn songs such as "Fur Elise." Most importantly, I am averse to working with money as I have been part of a group that sold snacks during nutritional breaks, dealing with impatient customers, which helped me understand customer service jobs better.

            I am currently an AP student at St. Edmund Campion, am able to speak an intermediate amount of French, and am independent enough to be able to live in Quebec by myself for a French program over the course of three weeks. I always like to plan out situations beforehand, so I can approach any problem with persistence, and because I am a drama student, I am able to quickly improvise problems, memorize information, and be very creative. As a piano student, I learned to be more disciplined, as I had to study every day in order to learn certain songs, such as "Fur Elise." Most importantly, however, I am averse to working with money, as I was a part of a group that sold snacks during nutritional breaks, and I've had to deal with impatient customers. This experience helped me get a better understanding of what it was like to work in a customer service job.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Accomplishments</h2>
        <p>
            Although I have received many achievements so far, a short list of them includes: playing the main villain in the musical; being a host in a talent show; being a member of the student council and music council; getting second place in a talent show in Quebec (where I sang a French song) against many participants; and getting the honor roll, student life, and drama award.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Personal Life</h2>
        <p>
            I consider myself to be an active person, as I bike to and from school, and play badminton occasionally when the weather is nice. One important issue I'm very passionate about is industrial fishing and the need to stop it, especially bottom trawling, which is degrading our marine life. Although I have visited many places, my favorite place is Summer Knights, a summer festival at my school where people play all sorts of games.
