 <p> Throughout my time in business class, I have learned a lot and achieved many accomplishments. Now that the business class is over, I have learned how to do a large range of tasks and how to operate a number of programs. The main way we learned was through projects and hands-on activities.

Some of the projects I have done are
</p>

">Excel Project</a></p>
<p>Why the artifact is a good example of your skills or knowledge. This artifact is a good example of my skills and knowldges, because it shows my capability to be able to use complex formulas.
 How it will help you as you move forward, whether in the world of business or otherwise. Using Exel will be very important, no matter what profession I chose to go with.
 Show connection to the Catholic Graduate Expectations and Social Teaching. This project ties with the Rights and Responsibilities Social teaching, as in the same way we need to know all</p><p> our Rights and Responsibilities, we also need to know all the functions inorder to properly use Excel

The second thing I learned is how to collect data in a streamlined fashion.

<h2><p style="color:blue;">Party Time Picnic Advetising </p></h2>
<p> In this project, I had to make an advertisment for a company picnic party. This assignment taught me alot about advertising and marketing, as well as how to use powerpoint in a more effective manner. Learning a little more about advertising was very benifical to me, as it helps me further grasp the concept of having to quickly grab the attention of a group of people.
